    Put CloudFront in front of the load balancer, which gives viewers HTTPS on

    This is on by default because the dashboard calls crypto.randomUUID()
    during mount: outside a secure context that throws and the page renders
    blank, so plain HTTP does not merely leak traffic, it breaks the app.

    Mutually exclusive with certificate_arn -- with a real certificate,
    terminate TLS at the load balancer and turn this off.
